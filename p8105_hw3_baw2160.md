Problem One:
------------

### install.packages("devtools")

``` r
devtools::install_github("p8105/p8105.datasets")
```

    ## Skipping install of 'p8105.datasets' from a github remote, the SHA1 (21f5ad1c) has not changed since last install.
    ##   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
```

### Read and clean data:

-   Formatted the data to use appropriate variable names.
-   Focused on the “Overall Health” topic.
-   Include only responses from "Excellent" to "Poor"
-   Organized responses as a factor taking levels from “Excellent” to “Poor”

``` r
brfss_data = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  filter(Topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  rename(Location_State = Locationabbr, Location_County = Locationdesc, Proportion = Data_value) %>%
  mutate(
    Response = as.factor(Response)
  )
```

### Answering some questions:

-   In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?

``` r
county_distinct = distinct(brfss_data, Location_County, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  count(Location_State) %>% 
  filter(n == 7)
```

**Answer:** CT, MT, NH, NM, OR, TN, UT

-   Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of observations in each state from 2002 to 2010.
-   Make a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State.
-   For each year and state, compute the average proportion in each response category (taking the average across locations in a state). Make a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over time.
